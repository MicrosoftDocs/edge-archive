# Special error properties from asynchronous Windows Runtime methods  

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/legacy-edge-note.md)]  

It can be difficult to debug asynchronous Windows Runtime methods in JavaScript, because the error may be thrown from somewhere deep in the call stack.  The JavaScript `Error` object has extra properties that appear only when the error is thrown from an asynchronous Windows Runtime method when the app is running in debug mode.  
  
## Special error properties  

An error object that results from a failed Windows Runtime asynchronous operation in debug mode has the following special properties:  

*   `asyncOpSource` \(Object\) Gets information about the original location where the call that produced an error was made.  The property `asyncOpSource.originatingCall` \(String\) displays the location in the user's code that originated the asynchronous operation.  
*   asyncOpType \(String\) Gets the name of the asynchronous operation type that raised the error.  
    
For more information about errors with asynchronous operations, see:
